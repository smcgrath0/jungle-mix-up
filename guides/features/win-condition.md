Instructions - Win Condition
--

### Overview

In this feature, a fourth card will be used to complete the base functionality of this project to "win" the game. We will be accomplishing this by matching two pairs of cards and displaying a modal.

<details>
   <summary>What is a modal?</summary> It is good to think of a modal as simply an element that is hidden and then shown to display information to the user, or to allow them to interact with the page for a specific purpose. (A good example of a modal is a pop up on any number of websites that asks you to register for an account). For the purposes of this project, create a div with text that informs the user they have won, and provide them with a button (or a div that is shaped like a button because they are easy to style) which they can click to restart the game and play again. It is also recommended that you hide and show the modal using the same .hidden class that you are using to hide the back of the cards when they are clicked. HINT the jQuery .addClass() and .removeClass() are very helpful for this.

### Feature Set

1. In your `index.html`, uncomment another card.
    - Add the proper background images to the child divs
    - There should now be a total of four cards displayed on the page.
2. In your `script.js`, declare another variable in the same global space as the previous variables:
    - `max_matches`
    - Set the of the `max_matches` value to the number 2
3. After each successful match of the two cards you have clicked:
    - check if your `matches` variable is equal to the `max_matches` variable
      - If true, display the modal to verify that there is a "win". This will now complete the game.
    - If false, nothing happens, the user will continue playing the game.

### After Each Feature

- When your feature implementation is complete, you will want to save and submit your work to the branch that you have created.
  - Use `git status` to check that you are on the correct branch that represents your feature.
  - You will want to **add**, **commit**, and **push** the code that you have written to the appropriate Github repository.
    1. `git add .`
    2. `git commit -m "Description of the feature that you have implemented"`
       - e.g. `git commit -m "Added simple HTML skeleton"`
    3. `git push origin FEATURE_NAME_HERE`
       - e.g. `git push origin skeleton`

- Finally, you will want to create a pull request. This will merge the code from your newly **completed** feature branch into your `master` branch.

  1. Navigate to <kbd>New Pull Request</kbd>:
